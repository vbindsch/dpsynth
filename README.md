# DP-Synth: A tool for data synthesis with differential privacy and privacy tests

DP-Synth is a C++ tool to produce synthetic datasets with differential privacy. By default, the tool uses a generative model based on Bayesian networks. But users can implement and use their own generative model.


Techniques used are detailed in the following publication:
```
Plausible Deniability for Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis. 
Vincent Bindschaedler, Reza Shokri, and Carl Gunter.
